# Wolfden Project: Predictive Modelling for Racing Outcomes

## Introduction

Welcome to the Wolfden Project, a comprehensive exploration into predictive modeling for horse racing outcomes. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the winning horse in a race, using a detailed dataset spanning three days of races across Australia. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately forecast race outcomes without relying on the "Final RSR" column, ensuring the integrity of the predictions.

## Executive Summary
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that outlines a detailed approach to analyzing and predicting horse racing outcomes. The project encompasses data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, tuning, and evaluation. The final models are designed to predict the winning horse with high accuracy and precision, providing valuable insights for racing enthusiasts and stakeholders.


## Data
The dataset includes comprehensive information about horse races conducted over three days in Australia. It features various attributes related to horses, jockeys, tracks, and race conditions, which are crucial for building an effective predictive model.


## Objective 
Create a model to predict which horse will win a race.


## Key Features
