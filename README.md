# Wolfden Project: Predictive Modelling for Racing Outcomes

## Introduction

I, Ben Khalesi, am pleased to participate in an internship challenge with Wolfden, focusing on leveraging Machine Learning to solve complex problems in horse racing predictions. This project is part of my application process for the internship program and is designed to showcase my analytical abilities and innovative approach to predictive modeling.

## Executive Summary

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive analysis and predictive modelling approach for racing outcomes over a 3-day period, with an emphasis on predicting which horse will win a race without access to the "Final RSR" column, to maintain the integrity of the predictions.

## Data

Dataset consists of detailed information about horse races conducted over three days across Australia.


## Objective 
Create a model to predict which horse will win a race.


## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Steps to load and clean the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Preparation**: Handling missing values, negative values, and erroneous entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extensive analysis including correlation analysis and visualizations to understand data relationships and distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques like frequency encoding to prepare the data for predictive modelling.
- **Model Selection and Tuning**: Evaluation and fine-tuning of the best performing models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using various metrics to ensure their effectiveness in predicting race outcomes.
- **Resampling Techniques**: Addressing class imbalance in the dataset to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Results

The models demonstrate high accuracy and precision in predicting outcomes, with detailed evaluations comparing different modeling approaches.

## Conclusions

The notebook concludes with insights into the model's performance and recommendations for further research and applications of the predictive models.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Scikit-learn for model building, evaluation, and tuning.
